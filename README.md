## Hi there! âœ¨  

I'm **Lana**, a Media Informatics student navigating the chaos of university life. Right now, my main goal is surviving this semester while diving deeper into **computer science, design, and storytelling**.  

### ðŸŽ“ Academic Interests  
- Studying **Media Informatics**, where tech meets creativity  
- Exploring **computer science**, UI/UX, and digital storytelling  
- Always looking for ways to blend **design, coding, and narrative**  

### ðŸŽ¨ Creative at Heart  
- Passionate about **graphic design** and making things visually engaging  
- Always working with music onâ€”probably reading or writing at the same time  

### ðŸ¦‡ Batfam Enthusiast  
- Big fan of the Batfamilyâ€”because who doesnâ€™t love **Richard Grayson** and **Jason Todd**?  
- Favorite pastime: overanalyzing **Bruce's A-grade parenting**  
- Can we stop for a moment and appreciates the chaos of Gothamâ€™s most dysfunctional family?
- Can and will debate Batfam dynamics for hours  

### ðŸ”® Marauders Era & Regulus Black Appreciation  
- James, Sirius, Remus, and Peter (yes, even himâ€¦ sometimes)  
- *Regulus Black supremacy*â€”because my poor boy deserved better 
- Wish we had a proper Marauders series instead of *The re-make*  

### ðŸš€ Let's Connect  
Open to ideas, collaborations, and deep Batfam/Marauders discussions.
